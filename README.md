# Google-Extensions-Course
Went through google extension courses.

4 different extensions were made :

- Reading Timer
  Put the time you need to read an article on consumerrighs.wiki
- Focus Mode
  Hide some useless info and change the display of an article on consumerrighs.wiki to be more readable. 
- Tabs Manager
  Group Google docs tabs inside Ã  DOCS Group if in the browser window and ungroup them if need.
- Service Worker
  Service Worker activated by "api" keyword, stores the history of google api docs visited and displays a random dev tip if you click on a button created on the Google API docs page.
